### Short decription

In 2017, I redesigned and developed Calibration Management's website, providing custom hosting, monthly maintenance, and SEO improvements to ensure their online presence remains strong and competitive. The goal was to give them a user-friendly platform that showcased their services effectively on all devices.  

### Recent Challenges

Upon revisiting the website's performance, I found significant issues, especially with mobile performance score failing and desktop needing improvements around the board. You can view the detailed analysis here: <a href=" https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-calibrationmanagement-com-au/59n3w6ugrb?form_factor=mobile" target="_blank">Page Insights</a>

### Future Improvements

Moving forward, I'm actively working on resolving the identified issues to transition Calibration Management from their legacy system to a more modern web platform. This shift will enhance the website's performance on both mobile and desktop devices. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and the exciting enhancements we'll be implementing for their website!
